  - Administrators no longer need to accept blanket access to an overloaded instance profile (or an equivalent) by all Workbench users so that they can access AWS resources.
  - Users do not need to manage sensitive, long-lived AWS credentials themselves to have individually-scoped permissions.
  - Administrators can grant or revoke granular AWS access for individuals at the Single Sign-On provider level.

::: {.column width="50%"}
- Addition of performance enhancements and monitoring performance metrics under high user load (100s of concurrent sessions).

# Posit Package Manager {#posit-package-manager background-image="_extensions/jthomasmock/positslides/assets/backgrounds/toc-dark.png" background-color="#17212B"}

## Posit Package Manager

<br>

Several new features in the 2023.04 release of Posit Package Manager provide administrators with greater control over the open-source packages available in internal R and Python repositories.

* Major updates to the PyPI source, significantly reducing sync time and increasing performance.
* Create curated subsets of PyPI with a `curated-pypi` source, allowing only the Python packages from PyPI you permit. 
* Globally block packages for an entire instance, preventing downloads of packages with known vulnerabilities or prohibited license types.

## Posit Public Package Manager

### Use Posit Package Manager to access historical CRAN packages

Following the announcement of the retirement of the Microsoft R Application Network (MRAN) at the end of June 2023, Posit has been working with Microsoft to preserve access to historic CRAN package snapshots.

* Translate the MRAN snapshot URL to point to Posit Public Package Manager or a local Posit Package Manager server by changing the server name.
* Public Package Manager is now also compatible with the checkpoint package, and it can be used in place of MRAN by setting the `checkpoint.mranUrl` option in R.
* Join the conversation on the [Package Management topic on Posit Community](https://community.rstudio.com/c/r-admin/package-manager/21).

# Shiny {#shiny background-image="_extensions/jthomasmock/positslides/assets/backgrounds/toc-dark.png" background-color="#17212B"}

## Shiny for Python is now generally available

We are thrilled to announce that Shiny for Python has moved from the alpha stage to general availability.

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="60%"}
We’ve gotten some great feedback during the alpha phase of the project, leading to several enhancements:

* Quickstart guide for R users.
* Interact with plots created using matplotlib, seaborn, and plotnine.
* A new package, shinywidgets, which makes it possible to use Jupyter widgets in a Shiny app, including Plotly and maps with Leaflet.

... and more!
